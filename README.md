A Simple Cryptographic Windows Application

I'm writing this application in order to remember what I learned when I was 14 joining a local C# programming class and as a school project. I also want to be better in SW development. So, whoever wants to tell me my flaws and teach me how to do programming better, I appreciate him/her a lot!
